\begin{abstract}
Studying properties of quantum system can lead to many improvements on our
ability to use quantum information/computing. In this spirit, this article
presents one of these quantum properties called contextuality. After presenting
it, I focus on a specific definition of contextuality that I studied in depth,
and show how it could be useful for quantum information.
\end{abstract}

Quantum Mechanics is know as a counter intuitive field, where things seen as
impossible in our day to day life are perfectly normal. The two examples
commonly given when mentioning this counter intuitive aspect of quantum
mechanics is mentioned are the superposition (the fact that Schrödinger's cat is
both dead and alive as long as its box isn't opened \cite{Sch35}) and the
entanglement (the fact that two particles can be in a state where acting on one
of them would seemingly immediately have an effect of the other, such as
measuring one of the qubits of the Bell state \cite{EPR35}). Other properties
such as the destructive nature of the quantum measure (also related to
Schrödinger's cat thought experiment) can be mentioned, but today, I will present
you a property that is less popular, but as disconcerting the first time you
cross its path: the \emph{contextuality}!

Contextuality is linked to another notion called locality (itself linked to
entanglement) as explored in \cite{AB11} and to hidden variable theories, but we
will focus here on a fresh look on the subject by trying to start from an easy to
grasp common ground, and introducing only strictly necessary notion as we go.

So! We call an situation contextual when it's actors need a knowledge of the
context in order to explain the aftermath of the situation. And we also need to
restrict the ability of the actors to only perform \emph{local} actions (no
faster than light communication). Given this, let's see a situation where we
would like to see if the situation is contextual or not.

Let's say that we are very worried about a loved one who is at the other end of
the world, potentially doing dangerous activities. In order to get reassured, we
go and see a medium which would help us see our loved one and make sure he/she
is doing OK. The medium welcomes us with a cryptic sentence "Your friend is
eating your lunch". At this point, you remember that you forgot the lunch you
just on the counter of the kitchen, with your dog (Milly). It seems like the
medium has a \emph{non local} knowledge of the world: he knows something that
happened at a distance and this without communication with the remote event. But
then you realize that it's 11:30, you still have your lunch ticket peeking out
of your pocket, and you have Milly's hairs on your trousers. These three
elements are part of the \emph{context} of the current situation, and this is
probably how the medium guessed what happened (or rather what is happening). So
in the end the experience you just lived could be explained by a contextual
explanation of the event, and the medium has likely no non local abilities.

\section{Formal definition}
\label{sec:formal_definition}

After this wacky example of contextuality in our classical world, let's come back
on a quantum definition of if. First, some useful notions: The Pauli matrices are
$$X=\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1\\
  1 & 0
\end{pmatrix},Y=\begin{pmatrix}
  0 &  -i\\
  i & 0
\end{pmatrix} \text{ and } Z=\begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0\\
  0 &-1
\end{pmatrix},$$
and we will also use the 2 by 2 identity matrix $I$ and the $n$ by $n$ matrix
$Id$.

We consider a thought experiment where we perform operations on a $n$ qubits
system, and I will show you that this thought experiment exhibits a contextual
behavior. The experiment is composed of several series of measurements using the
operators of the Pauli group. These operators are defined as a Pauli measurement
on each wire, with eventually a global phase. They are denoted
$$\mathcal{O} = s\bigotimes_{i=0}^n P_i$$
with $s\in\{\pm 1, \pm i\}$ and $P_i\in\{X,Y,Z,I\}$.
The result of such measurements is in $\pm 1$, and the overall result of the
experiment is the product of all measurement result. I will show you in Sec. 
\ref{sec:link_with_finite_geometries} that we can construct such experiments
where where quantum theory can produce a result non reproducible by classical,
non contextual theory.

\section{Link with other quantum specific properties}
\label{sec:link_with_other_quantum_specific_properties}

What we call quantum properties are quantum specific behaviors. They can arise
directly from the laws of quantum mechanics, such as the destructive nature of
measurements, but they can also be "meta" properties\footnote{this is not a
standard name in this context}, arising from the superposition of several other
quantum properties. Entanglement is the example of such a meta property
(we couldn't have entanglement without superposition), and contextuality is too:
the way quantum measurements work is absolutely necessary for quantum
contextuality (the fact that the measure projects the state on the space
corresponding to the result observed is the root of the contextual behaviors).

Understanding the links between these properties may help us build an intuition
concerning quantum computation. This is likely one of the reasons why they are
so studied! In that regard, let us have a look at one of the papers reveling on
of the deepest links in my opinion: the 2011 paper by S. Abramsky and A.
Brandenburger \cite{AB11}.

In this paper, the authors show that non locality and quantum contextuality are
in fact two ways to look at the same situation. And in a much deeper level, that
some of the concepts having a role in those meta properties are in fact not
necessarily related to quantum mechanics specifically but in a more general way
to the mathematical specificities of the probability distribution of the
associated measurement results.

\section{Link with finite geometries}
\label{sec:link_with_finite_geometries}

As teased in Sec. \ref{sec:formal_definition}, this contextuality property can
be exhibited using measures on a $n$ qubits system. The corresponding thought
experiment is decomposed as such: on this $n$ qubits system, we will perform
several series of measurements. If we represent each operator used for a
measurement by a dot, and each series of measurement by a line, we obtain what we
call a finite geometry. 

This formalism can be complexified such that the finite geometry would live in a
vector space, and this allows us to perform interesting operations on those
geometries, but I will leave that as a teaser for an upcoming Medium article
(for more information, you may read \cite{dHG+22}).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=6cm]{resources/mermin-square.png}}
\caption{The Mermin square}
\label{fig:mermin-square}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:mermin-square} represent such an experiment, where the operator
used are the points and the series of measurement are the lines (vertical and
horizontal) of this figure. Note that the last vertical line is doubled, we will
see shortly why that is.

First, let us check what the result of this experiment will be. Each operator
here has its eigenvalues in $\pm1$, meaning each result of a single measurement
will either be $1$ or $-1$. In addition, each line is built such that the
operators composing it commute (for two operators on a line $O_1$ and $O_2$,
$O_1O_2=O_2O_1$). With the rules of quantum mechanics, this results in the
fact that the product of the measurements is in the spectrum (the set of all
eigenvalues) of the product of the operators (if $r_i$ is the result of a
measure by $O_i$, $\prod_i r_i \in sp(\prod_i O_i)$). Given that each line was
also made such that the product of the operators is either $Id$ or $-Id$ (and
that $sp(Id)=\{1\}$), the product of the measures on each line will either be $1$
or $-1$. This is where our doubled line mentioned earlier comes into play: it is
the only one where the product of the result is $-1$. This means that the overall
product is $-1$ and this result cannot be reproduced by classical non contextual
local theories!

Such a theory (non contextual and local) can be modeled by a function that would
attribute to each point a value in $\pm1$ (the result of the "measurement"). Each
point being in two lines, the product of all measurements would in this case look
like $\prod_i f(O_i) \times \prod_i f(O_i) = (\prod_i f(O_i))^2 = 1$.

As you may have picked up, not all experiments similar to the one shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:mermin-square} can show this contextual behavior, the operators and
series of measurements have to be carefully chose.

\section{Link with quantum programs verification}
\label{sec:link_with_quantum_programs_verification}

Program verification is a concept that stems as early as from the beginning of
computer science. For instance, Hoare logic \cite{Hoa69} was introduced in 1969
where the now very famous C language was introduced in 1972! The idea behind
program verification is to \emph{prove} that the program written by the
programmer does what is was conceived to do. This proof is possible because a
program is in fact nothing but a series of logical instruction, so it can in fact
be translated as a series of application of a (mathematical) function to a
certain variable encoding the state of the system. The proof is then to show that
the output variable validates the condition imposed by the programmer, given the
input variable. Let us take a small example to explore this concept:
\begin{lstlisting}
$f_1$(x) = x+1; $f_2$(x) = 2x

program (n) {
  a = $f_1$(n);
  b = $f_2$(a);
  return b;
}
\end{lstlisting}
The program is supposed to compute $2n+1$, the condition for the input variable
(also called pre-condition) being that it's a number, the condition for the
output (also called post-condition) will be that it's a number and that 
\verb@program(n)=2n+1@. Given that one can show that we should have 
$2n+1=f_2(a)=2a$, and thus that $2n+1=2f_1(n)=2(n+1)$. Since this is false, we
showed that our function has a bug (without executing it)!

This is a very powerful way to verify programs, but it is pretty hard to
accomplish. My previous works put the focus on trying to ease this for quantum
program, by studying properties of quantum states that could be used in quantum
program verification. Contextuality is one of those properties, even if (as of
now) it wasn't used in this context.

\section*{At ColibrITD}

At \emph{colibrITD}, we create programs that efficiently solve our costumers'
industrial problems. Since we target industrial problems, bugs can be very
costly, so having tools to automate the verification of our quantum programs is
precious for us!
